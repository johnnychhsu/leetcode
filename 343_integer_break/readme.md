## 343. Integer Break
### Description
Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

### Solution
Consider break the number `n` into 2 number. Say we want to maximize `x(n-x)`. We can find that when `x=n/2` we can get the maximum.
