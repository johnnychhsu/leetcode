## 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of A Binary Tree

We can check whether `p` and `q` are in the same sub-tree. If both in left or right, then recursive the checking, else we find the lowest common ancestor. <br />
Of course we can iterativly solve this problem. We use the same concept, but use a loop.
